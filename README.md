Developing a website that forecasts profits based on standardized data sets

Workflow overview from the user side:
1. User will input/enter a keyword
2. Visualization of profits is made on the landing page
3. Based on the model created, a visualization of the prediction results of the model will be
displayed.
Workflow from me as a developer:
1) I will create a website landing page design (1 page) containing an input form &
visualization of profits data.
2) Research for dynamic data retrieval methods (users can input various data)
3) Start collecting datasets & testing whether the method is dynamic or not
4) based on the diverse data, research which deep learning model is most suitable for
dynamic data. Improvising website design to make it more user friendly.
5) website/local host functionality testing
